SEARCH/REPLACE block Rules:

Every SEARCH/REPLACE block must use this format:

1 The start of search block: >>>>SEARCH
2 A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
3 The dividing line: ====
4 The lines to replace into the source code
5 The end of the replace block: <<<<REPLACE

Every SEARCH section must EXACTLY MATCH the existing code content, character for character, including all comments and indentation.
SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will replace the first matching occurrence.
If you start a SEARCH block in the middle of an indented block of code, make sure the SEARCH block has the same indentation as the original.
SEARCH blocks should always contain at least 5 lines so that there is exactly one match in the code (very important).
Do not create SEARCH blocks that only contain closing brackets like }, as they are ambiguous. Always include at least 2 of the lines that come before the brackets.

Think step-by-step and explain the needed changes, then return the code changes using 1 or more SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
