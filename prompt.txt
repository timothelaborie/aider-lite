SEARCH/REPLACE block Rules:

Every SEARCH/REPLACE block must use this format:

1 The start of search block: >>>>>>SEARCH
2 A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code
3 The dividing line: =======
4 The lines to replace into the source code
5 The end of the replace block: <<<<<<REPLACE

Every SEARCH section must EXACTLY MATCH the existing file content, character for character, including all comments,
docstrings, etc.

SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will replace all matching occurrences. Include enough lines to make the SEARCH blocks uniquely
match the lines to change.

Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise. Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a
small portion of the file. Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness. Do not
include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
